The United Arab Emirates, while relatively new, having only been established in 1971, is an country which is having to develop much of its public services at a relatively quick rate to match the massive influx of people immigrating to the country. Education is no exception to this with both an increase in non-local educators working in education, and workers in other sectors bringing their children to be educated in the country.

This has lead to an education system which is both rapidly catching up with that of much older countries, and one which does not have the history and baggage of those countries. As a result, the education system can be much more mobile and can afford to be more forward thinking that more established systems. 

One of the major initiatives taking place at present is that of innovation in education. This initiative is the focus of this research with numerous strands within that. Broadly speaking, the initiative will be looking at in the following ways: 

\begin{itemize}
\item What is innovation in education and what is the goal of the initiative?

\end{itemize}

•	1, What is the focus of your enquiry?
•	2, What questions are you trying to answer?
•	3, What are your hypotheses or hunches?
•	4, Why are these questions and hypotheses important to you and your institution?
•	5, What contextual information is important to bear in mind? (E.g. 'the school is single sex' or 'the children are year seven')
