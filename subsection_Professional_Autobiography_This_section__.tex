\subsection{Professional Autobiography}
This section is about articulating your experiences, beliefs and values on the topic of your choice. This might help to focus your study and will enable you to identify and explore your personal bias in the account. 

A “professional autobiography” in research terms is seen by some as fundamental. The argument is made that your experiences have influenced your beliefs and values and how you see the world. You life and career experience has led you to ask the questions that you are asking and will influence your analysis of them.

This argument suggests that the inherent bias of the researcher is best exposed and acknowledged rather than claiming that your research is completely objective. 

Produce an autobiography that reflects you as you have developed to become the professional you are - include: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Key moments or critical incidents that have shaped the way you think and work, 
\item People, research, experiences and or theories that have been important to you in your career and the influence that they have had on you and why;
\item The issues and concerns you have;
\item Why you are interested in your current topic;
\item Outline any bias you may bring to the research and how you intend to deal with these;
\end{itemize}
