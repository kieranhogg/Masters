Describe and evaluate the actions you took. What helped or hindered the activities? Avoid too much narrative, but critically discuss the processes of conducting the research. Aspects such as designing a research instrument or piloting your data collection methods are appropriate to discuss referring to the research literature and how it prepared or informed you, or not, for the activity. Reflection upon your activities once they have finished will increase your learning.
