\subsection{The Methodology of Research and Justification}
The research is best categorised as an investigation. That is, the brief handed to schools has been fairly open and the length of time schools have had to implement it is short. The expectation of large culture changes is obviously unfounded however the level to which schools have acknowledged, understood and implemented any innovation initiatives is the overall focus.
