\subsection{Introduction, Focus and Overview}

The United Arab Emirates is a relatively new country, having only been established in 1971, which is having to develop much of its public services at a relatively quick rate to match the massive influx of people immigrating to the country. Education is no exception to this with both an increase in non-local educators working in education, and workers in other sectors bringing their children to be educated in the country. This has lead to an education system which is both rapidly catching up with that of much older countries, and one which does not have the history and baggage of those countries. As a result, the education system can be much more mobile and can afford to be more forward thinking that more established systems. 

One of the major initiatives taking place at present is that of innovation in education. This initiative is the focus of this research with numerous strands within that. Broadly speaking, the initiative will be looked at in the following ways: 

\begin{itemize}
\item What is innovation in education and what is the goal of the initiative?
\item What form of innovation has taken place in schools so far?
\item How consistent is the interpretation of innovation between schools across the region?
\item How do the above answers compare to a more developed educational system?
\item Has there been any impact so far? What is the predicted future impact?

\end{itemize}

Hypothetically I think that there will have been some good work from schools so far but that how schools have interpreted it and implemented it so far will differ. That is not to say that this is a bad thing, one of the hopeful outcomes of this research is a clearer picture which will enable other educators to learn from others.

I think the difference in implementation will be a reflection of the diversity present in education in the UAE with various different types of educational establishments, staffed by many different nationalities, which are all at different stages of their educational lives.

•	1, What is the focus of your enquiry?
•	2, What questions are you trying to answer?
•	3, What are your hypotheses or hunches?
•	4, Why are these questions and hypotheses important to you and your institution?
•	5, What contextual information is important to bear in mind? (E.g. 'the school is single sex' or 'the children are year seven')
