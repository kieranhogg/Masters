\begin{quote}
The principal goal of education is to create men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply of repeating what other generations have doneâ€¦ who are discoverers. We need pupils who are active, who learn early to find out for themselves, partly by their own spontaneous activity and partly through the materials we set up for them.

 - Jean Piaget (1896-1981), educational psychologist
