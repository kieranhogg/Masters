Innovation is a word and concept most are familiar with, with it being an idea which is applicable to almost every aspect of every business, and it usually is. In Figure \ref{fig:popularity}, the popularity of innovation as a search term form the Google search engine is shown. Aside from the bi-annual dip in July and December (when presumably most of the world is taking a break from work), the popularity of the term has remained fairly constant since 2004, albeit with a slight decrease.

As a word in the 21st century, for most people it would conjure images of technology and the Internet, indeed the most related phrase according to Google is "technology innovation"\footnote{https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=innovation}. As an innovation, the increase in prevalence of home technology and access to the Internet is rightly the most common example. A close second is "business innovation" which is where the word is commonly used, indeed the companies that produce the aforementioned technology would be themselves good examples of innovation companies.

One of the areas perhaps not as traditionally thought of as being innovative is education, at least not to the layperson. The idea of an educator who holds knowledge and dictates that to students has changed somewhat over the last hundred years but the core idea of that is still seen in most classrooms even today. For those more familiar with educational developments will appreciate that while this is true, there have been, and continue to be many changes and innovations that take place within education. The three-part lesson has been introduced and remained popular; learning styles have come and are perhaps on the way out; personalisation and better understanding of SEN students has been a huge positive development for the better.

At any given time, there are numerous entities researching and implement different ideas and changes in education, some hugely innovative, some less so. Sometimes the impetus for change comes from Governments, sometimes from schools, sometimes from teachers and occasionally from other actors such as parents and students. This research will focus on an innovation drive introduced by the Government of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.

The United Arab Emirates is one of the fastest developing countries in the world\footnote{It has been on the World Bank list of high-income economies since 1987 \cite{worldbank} and is 41st in the UN Human Development Index \cite{WorkforHumanDevelopment2015}}, having only been established in 1971, which is developing many of its public services at a rapid rate to match the massive influx of people migrating to the country. Education is no exception to this with an increase in both non-local educators working in education, and workers in other sectors bringing their children to be educated in the country. This has led to an education system which is both rapidly catching up with that of much older countries, and one which does not have the history and baggage of those countries. 

The UAE is comprised of seven emirates, the largest and home to the eponymously-named capital city is Abu Dhabi. Schools in Abu Dhabi come in two forms: public schools which use the curriculum set by the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) and offer free education to Emirati children and private schools which are fee-paying and typically follow a foreign curriculum such as British or American. Whilst private schools are more independent in their operation and curriculum, ADEC still has a role in inspecting these schools to ensure overall quality and compliance across the emirate.

At the start of the 2015-2016 academic year, a unified inspection framework for schools in the UAE was published by the ADEC and their counterpart organisations from different emirates. One of the new additions to the framework, which otherwise looks broadly similar to most developed countries', was the addition of innovation as an additional focus. To put it into perspective, it is given roughly the same amount of space in the framework as more established educational ideas such as inclusion. ADEC discuss innovation as follows:

\begin{quote}
Innovation comes in many forms. There are innovations in the way schools are owned, organised and managed; in curriculum design models; in teaching and learning approaches, such as the ways in which learning technologies are used; classroom design including virtual spaces; assessment; timetabling; partnerships to promote effective learning and engagement in the economy; and the ways in which teachers and leaders are recruited, trained, developed and rewarded. These innovations can be small or large, recognisable or entirely new and different.

Innovation is driven by a commitment to excellence and continuous improvement. Innovation is based on curiosity, the willingness to take risks and to experiment to test assumptions. Innovation is based on questioning and challenging the status quo. It is also based on recognising opportunity and taking advantage of it. Being innovative is about looking beyond what we currently do well, identifying the great ideas of tomorrow and putting them into practice.
\end{quote} \cite[p.12]{ADEC2015}

The idea of innovation in education is not a new one but the inclusion in such a prominent position of an inspection framework indicates the importance that ADEC and the UAE is placing on innovation, indeed they make reference to the UAE Vision 2021 as justification to the inclusion of innovation as an educational focus. There are many references to innovation in the vision, but the clearest one states: "We want the UAE to transform its economy into a model where growth is driven by knowledge and innovation." \cite{UAEGovernment2012} The importance placed in this area, the slightly surprising inclusion and the lack of exposure to it were the driving factors for choosing this as an area to focus on.

Due to the age of the initiative, the research will be conducted in an inductive manner; that is there will be no formal hypothesis to test. This research will follow the development of this formalisation of innovation in the academic year following its introduction. The aim is to both gauge the response from schools to the addition, but also to collate best practices for others to use.


Hypothetically I think that there will have been some good work from schools so far but that how schools have interpreted it and implemented it so far will differ. That is not to say that this is a bad thing, one of the hopeful outcomes of this research is a clearer picture which will enable other educators to learn from others.

I think the difference in implementation will be a reflection of the diversity present in education in the UAE with various different types of educational establishments, staffed by many different nationalities, which are all at different stages of their educational lives.

Broadly speaking, the initiative will be looked at in the following ways: 

\begin{itemize}
\item What is innovation in education and what is the goal of the initiative?
\item What form of innovation has taken place in schools so far?
\item How consistent is the interpretation of innovation between schools across the region?
\item How do the above answers compare to a more developed educational system?
\item Has there been any impact so far? What is the predicted future impact?

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Professional Autobiography}

\begin{quote}
This section is about articulating your experiences, beliefs and values on the topic of your choice. This might help to focus your study and will enable you to identify and explore your personal bias in the account. 

A “professional autobiography” in research terms is seen by some as fundamental. The argument is made that your experiences have influenced your beliefs and values and how you see the world. You life and career experience has led you to ask the questions that you are asking and will influence your analysis of them.

This argument suggests that the inherent bias of the researcher is best exposed and acknowledged rather than claiming that your research is completely objective. 

Produce an autobiography that reflects you as you have developed to become the professional you are - include: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Key moments or critical incidents that have shaped the way you think and work, 
\item People, research, experiences and or theories that have been important to you in your career and the influence that they have had on you and why;
\item The issues and concerns you have;
\item Why you are interested in your current topic;
\item Outline any bias you may bring to the research and how you intend to deal with these;
\item What beliefs and values are revealed by these?
\end{itemize}

My educational background has always been heavily focused around computers and technology. My secondary education took in A-Level ICT and Computing, which naturally led me to a degree in Computer Science. During my degree I was fortunate to work for a software company for a year full time and a further year part time. This was followed by a PGCE in ICT.

Upon my qualification, ICT qualifications taught in England were still very prescriptive and based around the teaching of Microsoft Office skills. As a result of my background, I felt naturally inclined to innovate with technology and the curriculum where it allowed. As a result, I feel fairly strongly that innovation is not the use of technology in the classroom by itself. I believe it can be a part when used correctly, but simple use of technology is not. To take an extreme example, effective use of interactive white boards is something mentioned within this sphere, indeed many schools will still offer new staff training on them. Rather shockingly, they were developed in 1990 and by 2007, 98\% \cite{kitchen2008harnessing} of secondary schools had them in every classroom. They are simply tools of teaching trade now. They do however, offer a positive example of a technological innovation improving teaching and learning, having become such a mainstay in modern classrooms.

My natural inclination therefore is to see innovation within education as holistic rather that one particular idea. This will obviously affect my initial opinion but will have no effect on the analysis of the data relating to how other teachers view it.

The use of technology has always come naturally so my inclination has always been to pursue technology in an effort to make my teaching and learning either easier, or more engaging. The reason for innovation and technology becoming almost synonymous in technology is twofold: a lot of technology can be genuinely innovative, probably more easily so than anything other than teaching styles, and secondly for many teachers, technology is the most obvious way to innovate within the classroom. I therefore tend to view innovation more favourably than most; I very very rarely have negative associations with it the way some teachers do, especially when it comes to technology.

My interest in the topic is comprised of a few different angles of personal relevance. I currently work in a new school which is not only innovative at present, but has many innovative plans for the future. I am keen to see innovation as a driving force for change in schools rather than as a tick box used during inspections. During my career I have had the opportunity to observe and work with many innovative projects, both technological and otherwise. Some have worked, some have not, as is the case for the innovation process. The projects based around technology have proved to be useful lessons from the perspective of someone with a great interest in the area. With the focus on innovation being so prominent, I am keen to be able to find similar examples in the local area to collate and share within this research.

Teaching is both an amazingly collaborative profession as evidenced by the amazing amount of resources online and the rich personal learning networks that have emerged on platforms such as twitter, and an incredibly personal profession as evidenced by anyone who has written a lesson plan because an online one wouldn't be quite right. One of the hopes of this research is to share some best practice in this area.
